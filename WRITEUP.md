# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

I will deploy my application in App Service insted of VM because : 
 - Azure web service is more cheaper than VM.
 - Azure web service need less effort Compared to VM need some effort to manage security , enviroment ... etc
 - Azure web service easy to deploy by connect to github
 - Azure web service High availability, auto-scaling, and support of both Linux and Windows environments.


### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

For this project and current situation i will use app service, but if scope of my project is expand and i need add some plugin or service using some language not supported by azure web server i will choose the VM.
